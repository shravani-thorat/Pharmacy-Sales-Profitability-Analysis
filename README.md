# Pharmacy-Sales-Profitability-Analysis
This repository contains my submission for the Onyx Data Challenge, where I analyzed pharmacy sales and profitability data across multiple European countries using Power BI. The goal of this project was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through interactive dashboards and data storytelling.

## Project Overview
Pharmacies operate on thin margins, making it crucial to understand:
- Which regions and countries drive revenue
- How promotions impact profitability
- Which product categories balance volume and margin effectively
This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly answer these questions and make data-driven decisions.

## Key KPIs
- Total Revenue: €8.6M  
- Total Margin: €2.4M  
- Units Sold: 446K  
- Profit Margin %: 28%  
- Average Revenue per Pharmacy:  €71.9K  

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Business Analytics & Visualization

## Key Business Insights
- Certain countries generate high revenue but relatively lower margins
- Urban pharmacies contribute the highest revenue share
- Prescription products drive revenue, while OTC and wellness offer better margin opportunities
- Promotions increase volume but can negatively impact margins if not optimized
